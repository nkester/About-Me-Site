**What defines my professional life, what is my professional "why":** I strive to bring clarity to problems and provide actionable approaches to help our leaders make informed decisions. 
  - The context: Our national security, local government, and business leaders face increasingly complex and complicated problems. Unclear or unintuitive solutions compound these problems. I strive to help leaders make sense of this environment to better themselves, their constituents (and customers), and our society.
  
**My How:** Through self work and leading cross functional teams, I apply the following methods and techniques:  
  - Remain ruthlessly focused on providing value to the customer or decision maker. Novel solutions only matter if they are usefull and valuable to the user.  
  - Ask pointed questions to help myself, my team, and the decision maker develop and understand the problem.
  - Apply Disciplined Agile practices to guide the problem solving process and deliver value.
  - Acknowledge the things we don't or can not know, and account for them in our analysis.  
  - Simplicity and explainability always trump complex and convoluted. 
  - Apply Operations Research and Systems Analysis techiques that span the spectrum from Operational Assessments, Systems Engineering, Economics, and Data Science.
  

I excel at achieving desired effects with minimal guidance and oversight in environments that demand self-motivated leadership.
