<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="organizational-budget-formulation-tool">Organizational Budget Formulation Tool</h3>
<p><strong>SETAF-AF</strong> | 2023</p>
<p>Formulating government budgets require organizations to describe all the requirements they have and which congressional appropriation they apply to. Some requirements have components that span multiple appropriations so there are dependencies among them. Likewise, some requirements are more important to fund than others which we may assume risk on (partially fund) or simply go without having them. Clearly, we are often not provided enough resources in each appropriation to fund all the things we want or need to do so these appropriations constrain this problem. The size and complexity of this problem is challenging to solve by hand and when it is, the solution is often sub-optimal and includes errors or oversights.</p>
<p>To address this, we developed a value function that attributed value to each budget item based on a number of factors and then built a linear programming model that attempted to maximize the value while constrained by the size of each appropriation previously mentioned. This resulted in a transparent, repeatable, and rapid process to formulate an initial budget that the organization’s finance department could then fine tune and publish.</p>

<section id="program-planning-and-operations-assessment-methodology-and-process" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="program-planning-and-operations-assessment-methodology-and-process">Program Planning and Operations Assessment Methodology and Process</h3>
<p><strong>SETAF-AF</strong> | 2021 - 2024</p>
<p>Every organization has some goal or objective it is tries to meet. The next logical questions are: “Are we getting there?” and “How do we make our operations more effective at reaching our desired outcomes?” These questions are hard to ask and require organizations to have a learning mindset and be willing to acknowledge what and how operations are conducted could be improved. I led a team that developed an Operations Assessment Methodology and implementation process that provided analytic rigor and structure to the process of asking the right questions of our operations and the changes in the environment we want to see to identify tangible actions our staff and leaders could take to make operations more effective.</p>

<p><strong>USSOCOM</strong> | 2021</p>
<p>Using a simple Shiny reactive web framework tool built in the R programming language, my team and I tool that allowed users to visualize a social network graph and interact with the nodes. While simple, this tool allowed users to visualize a social network from a large cloud deployed database, select nodes of interest, and then ask additional interesting questions of those nodes to further their analysis.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="report-summary-and-content-analysis">Report Summary and Content Analysis</h3>
<p><strong>USSOCOM</strong> | 2020</p>
<p>Large organizations produce too many reports for everyone to read, absorb, and understand. Likewise, these reports are often distributed in hard copy or picture form (scanned images). This project aimed to extract meaning from these flat document images and present users with high level themes and messages contained in the document so they could decide what and how much to read. I used optical character recognition (OCR) to convert the images back into text, performed some text cleaning to eliminate as much noise introduced by OCR as possible, store the information in a database, and then perform basic text analytics to present users with those themes and messages.</p>

<section id="command-surgeon-research-query-and-summary-tool" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="command-surgeon-research-query-and-summary-tool">Command Surgeon Research Query and Summary Tool</h3>
<p><strong>USSOCOM</strong> | 2020</p>
<p>The organization gets requests for information on a myriad of topics and concerns that we must research and provide responses for. When those questions deal with medical issues, the Command’s Surgeon team often reference the National Institutes of Health (NHI)’s National Library of Medicine web platform called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubMed</a>. Using this tool, they can search for published research regarding their question. The problem, however, is that this process is long, cumbersome, and requires the team to read through many publications to find relevant work.</p>
<p>My team and I developed a tool that addressed this problem in several ways. First, it employed a simple machine learning algorithm to summarize all paper abstracts returned by PubMed search request into two sentences, allowing the Command Surgeon’s team to rapidly find papers of interest. Second, it allowed the user to export reports based on the search term and its results, with those summarized abstracts for reference after the fact.</p>
<p>As the Agile Project Manager, I led the team to develop this tool using a Micro-Services Architecture (MSA) that we deployed in a managed kubernetes environment on a cloud service provider. We used Helm to manage and automate the deployment into kubernetes and the configuration of the MSA.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="funding-prioritization-tool">Funding Prioritization Tool</h3>
<p><strong>USSOCOM</strong> | 2020</p>
<p>Requesting funding for large scale construction projects within the U.S. Government requires significant planning, prioritization, and trades between competing requirements. This project aimed to make that process more transparent, easier to iterate, and to find efficiency. The development team built and deployed this as a web accessible tool to support staff conferences in which users input their requirements, the relative value of each project, and several other requirement categories to determine which and in what way each project should be funded.</p>
<p>Aside from the actual prioritization, a major result from this project was simply describing and documenting the process, what considerations mattered in how the decisions were made, and who provided those inputs.</p>

<p><strong>USSOCOM</strong> | 2019 - 2021</p>
<p>In order to scale the use of data and analytics in any organization, practitioners require access to tools and systems that support their work and help them demonstrate value to their leaders.</p>
<p>As the program manager for the Data Analytics Environment, I led a team of three highly skilled and technical developers that built and managed a suite of tools and capabilities available to a globally distributed team of data analysts and data scientists. These tools supported their work and furthered the command’s data literacy and adoption of analytics through rapid, free, and flexible access to tools and capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Army Materiel Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA)</strong> | 2014 - 2016</p>
<p>This critical study, led by the Maneuver Center of Excellence (MCoE), aimed to evaluate the required performance and technical feasibility of the next generation of the Soldier Rifle. This highly collaborative study included engagement from MCoE, AMSAA, TRAC, ARL, ARCIC, ARDEC, NATICK, USMA, and others. To support this, I developed the combat modeling scenarios used to evaluate the system designs and developed data analysis tools to access, analyze, and visualize the modeling output results.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="discrete-event-system-specification-distributed-modeling-framework-devs-dmf">Discrete Event System Specification Distributed Modeling Framework (DEVS-DMF)</h3>
<p><strong>AMSAA</strong> | 2015 - 2016</p>
<p>This study, in collaboration with the United States Military Academy’s Systems Engineering Department, explored the possibility of deploying models representing individual aspects of a combat simulation model (the act of acquiring a target, the delivery accuracy of a small arms weapon, the effects of that projectile on a target, etc.) remotely in a cloud environment. Executing this in a DEVS environment allows the models to run independently of each other and leverage significantly more computing power than is resident on a local machine. Leveraging frameworks such as these, paired with advanced Design of Experiment techniques, allow analysts to explore the most important regions of the design space.</p>

<p><strong>AMSAA</strong> | 2015 - 2016</p>
<p>Under the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME) Program Office, I ran the models and analysis to update CDE tables for new or updated ground to ground munitions. I also participated in the CDE Working Groups to develop modeling improvements that strove to balance the flexibility desired by operators with the risk mitigation measures provided by the CDE methodology.</p>

<p><strong>AMSAA</strong> | 2015 - 2016</p>
<p>This study, led by the TRADOC Analysis Center (TRAC), evaluated viable alternatives to the M113 to support Field Artillery and Engineer units at Echelons Above Brigade (EAB). The AMSAA Mobility and Survivability teams evaluated each candidate’s performance and provided that feedback to TRAC to combine with their results of combat modeling performance. I provided experiential knowledge on the platforms and requirements specific to the U.S. Army Combat Engineer Military Occupational Specialty (MOS)</p>
